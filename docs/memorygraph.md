## Memory Protocol

### REQUIRED: Before Starting Work

You MUST use `recall_memories` before any task. Query by project, tech, or task type.

### REQUIRED: Automatic Storage Triggers

Store memories on ANY of:

- **Git commit** → what was fixed/added
- **Bug fix** → problem + solution
- **Version release** → summarize changes
- **Architecture decision** → choice + rationale
- **Pattern discovered** → reusable approach

### Timing Mode (default: on-commit)

`memory_mode: immediate | on-commit | session-end`

### Memory Fields

- **Type**: solution | problem | code_pattern | fix | error | workflow
- **Title**: Specific, searchable (not generic)
- **Content**: Accomplishment, decisions, patterns
- **Tags**: project, tech, category (REQUIRED)
- **Importance**: 0.8+ critical, 0.5-0.7 standard, 0.3-0.4 minor
- **Relationships**: Link related memories when they exist

Do NOT wait to be asked. Memory storage is automatic.

## Project Memory Protocol

This project uses MemoryGraph for team knowledge sharing.

### When to Store

- Solutions to project-specific problems
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- Deployment procedures and gotchas
- Performance optimizations
- Bug fixes and root causes

### Tagging Convention

Always include these tags:

- Project name: "my-app"
- Component: "auth", "api", "database", etc.
- Type: "fix", "feature", "optimization", etc.

### Example

When fixing a bug:

1. Store the problem (type: problem)
2. Store the solution (type: solution)
3. Link them: solution SOLVES problem
4. Tag both with component and "bug-fix"
